# 👋 Hi, I’m MOMO (Mingzhe MOMO)
**Funds × AI Intelligence × Dual-Win Asset Strategy**

I build **MOMO FinSphere**, an AI-driven financial intelligence system that integrates fund analysis, income strategies, crypto drawdown models, and warrant-filter APIs.  
My goal is to create **data-driven tools** that help investors make clear, structured, and repeatable decisions.

## 🛠 FinTech Tools I Built  
All tools are independently designed and developed by me, including modeling, algorithms, UI, API, automation, and deployment.

### 📌 Crypto Strategy Tools
- **BTC / ETH Drawdown Trigger — Smart Entry Model**  
  https://nms3194949.github.io/MOMO_FinSphere/tools/btc-rebound-trigger.html  
  → Detects 20–40% pullbacks from quarterly highs, simulates 2× to 25× leverage entry strategies.

### 📌 Fund Intelligence
- **FundMetric Pro (CAGR Mobile Edition)**  
  https://nms3194949.github.io/MOMO_FinSphere/tools/cagr-mobile.html  
  → Calculates CAGR, dividend impact, multi-period comparisons, and provides visualized export features.

### 📌 Warrant Smart Filtering  
- **Warrant Filter API**  
  https://warrant-render-proxy-1.onrender.com/  
  → Cleans inconsistent market data and returns optimal warrant selections via API.

## 💡 Core Philosophy: The “Dual-Win Strategy”
> **Monthly income × Capital growth = Real compounding**

The foundation behind all my tools:

- Avoid single high-yield funds that decay principal  
- Evaluate funds with 1M/3M/6M/1Y/3Y/5Y multi-period consistency  
- Use AI + models, not emotion  
- Create *repeatable, quantitative* decision frameworks  
- Build long-term survival strategies for every investor
